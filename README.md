# Sheet Ops exercise

Thank you for going through this process with us! This is our technical challenge.

This repository includes Elixir, JavaScript and Clojure versions of the same exercise.
Feel free to pick any one of them. Each directory has a README explaining the exercise
in more detail.

When you are done, open a pull request with your solution. We will review it
and add some comments.

Then we can set up a call to talk more about your submission: how
you thought about the problem, what (if anything) you would do differently under
different constraints, etc.

The goal here is to evaluate:
* How you approach a problem and decide what to prioritize
* Your programming skills
* Your standards about what makes a good solution to a problem
* How you communicate to share your contribution with the team

Although the challenge does not involve a lot of code, understanding the problem
and the provided algorithm usually takes some time. There is no expectation on how much
time you should spend on the exercise, however historically candidates have spent
anywhere from 3 to 12 hours.
